# TokenLens — Workspace Documentation

## Overview

**TokenLens** (package name `token-lens`) is a VS Code extension that displays LLM token usage and cost analytics directly in the VS Code status bar and a sidebar panel. It polls the [z.ai](https://z.ai) cloud API for quota limits, queries the local Kilo SQLite database for per-project and per-day usage data, and fetches OpenRouter pricing data for model cost estimation.

- **Version:** 1.5.3
- **Engine:** VS Code ^1.116.0
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode, ES2022, Node16 modules)
- **Build:** esbuild → `dist/extension.js` (CJS, Node), `dist/webview-client.js` (IIFE, browser), and `dist/webview-client.css` (Tailwind-processed webview CSS)

### Data Sources

| Source | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| z.ai API | `https://api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit` | Quota percentage, reset time (status bar) |
| OpenRouter API | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` | Model pricing data for cost estimation (cached 1 hour; project-level comparisons additionally apply provider and recency filters, while the global cost list applies UI filters client-side) |
| Local DB | `~/.local/share/kilo/kilo.db` | Per-project and per-day token breakdowns (sidebar) |

### UI Components

1. **Status Bar Item** (`extension.ts`)
   - Shows current token usage percentage (e.g. `$(zap) 42%`)
   - Color-coded background: normal → warning (≥50%) → error (≥80%)
   - Rich Markdown tooltip with `Token Lens - zai`, a single-row gradient z.ai usage bar plus percentage, and time until reset
   - Auto-refreshes on a configurable interval (default 5 minutes, adjustable via Settings panel)
   - Distinguishes loading, missing-key/auth failures, and transient API failures instead of treating every failure as "no API key"
   - Keeps the last successful quota snapshot during transient failures or rate limits, marks it stale, and retries with backoff before returning to the normal 5-minute poll

2. **Sidebar Panel** (`tokenSidebar.ts` + `html.ts` + `src/webview/*` + `webview-ui/src/*`)
    - Activity bar icon (`icons/token-stack-lens.svg`; legacy variant: `icons/zai.svg`)
    - Webview with three tabs: **Projects**, **Time**, and **Cost**
      - **Quota section:** Progress bar showing current quota usage percentage and time until reset (fed by the serialized `QuotaStateData.summary` subset of `QuotaSummary`), plus explicit loading/stale/unavailable/auth states when quota refreshes fail.
      - **Hero section:** Summary stats — today's tokens, total tokens, total cost, and total steps across all projects.
      - **Projects tab:** Expandable cards showing the project name with a total-token badge, per-project token breakdown (input, output, reasoning, cache read/write), cost, step count, session count, and duration. Includes stacked color bar visualization. Expanded view includes per-project SVG line chart, LLM usage breakdown, and model cost estimates from OpenRouter pricing data with inline loading/unavailable states while pricing refreshes.
      - **Time tab:** Includes a Daily/Weekly/Monthly period switcher and two sub-views toggled via a Cards/Graph pill switcher:
        - **Cards view:** Intersection-observer-based lazy-loaded list of day-by-day usage with horizontal bar charts. Each day's bars are scaled relative to that day's highest token type value (not across all days), so the dominant token type always fills 100%. Rows support expand/collapse.
        - **Graph view:** SVG line charts for Total Tokens (area fill), Token Breakdown (multi-series), Sessions And Steps, and LLM Usage (pie chart). Summary stat labels and chart data update with the active daily/weekly/monthly aggregation, and series can be toggled via legend buttons.
      - **Cost tab:** Estimated per-model cost list with provider/sort/age filters. The tab displays the current OpenRouter pricing status, disables filters while pricing is unavailable or still loading, and shows skeleton rows instead of silently hiding pricing results during refresh. Clicking a model in this list saves it to VS Code `globalState` so the pinned models persist across workspaces and are included alongside project/period-specific models in cost comparisons across the Projects and Time tabs.
     - **Data injection:** On first load, `src/webview/document.ts` serializes the payload into a `<script type="application/json">` tag and `webview-ui/src/bootstrap.ts` parses it. After the Preact root attaches its message listener, it sends a `{ type: "ready" }` handshake so the extension can safely replay the latest payload. The sidebar provider only applies the latest completed refresh, so slower stale refreshes cannot overwrite a newer quota snapshot. Subsequent updates are sent via `postMessage` with a `{ type: "fullUpdate", data: WebviewData }` message, received by the `Root` wrapper in `webview-ui/src/main.tsx` which updates Preact state incrementally — preserving scroll position, active tab, expanded cards, and filter state.
      - **Webview persistence:** cost filters are stored with VS Code webview state (`acquireVsCodeApi().getState()/setState()`). Saved models are persisted globally via VS Code `globalState` so they are shared across all workspaces.

## Build & Development

### Prerequisites

- Bun
- VS Code ^1.116.0

### Dependencies

#### Runtime

- `dayjs` - local day bucketing, cache timing, and date-based summary calculations
- `drizzle-orm` - typed query layer over the local Kilo SQLite database
- `preact` - lightweight React-compatible library for the webview sidebar UI
- `sql.js` - WASM SQLite runtime used to read `~/.local/share/kilo/kilo.db`

#### Development

- `@types/node`
- `@types/vscode`
- `esbuild`
- `esbuild-plugin-tailwindcss`
- `eslint`
- `tailwindcss`
- `typescript`
- `typescript-eslint`

### Scripts

| Script | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| test | `bun test` | Runs the regression check for local-timezone day bucketing in `src/db.ts` |
| compile | `bun run compile` | Type-checks, lints, bundles the extension plus webview JS/CSS, then copies the SQL.js WASM asset |
| watch | `bun run watch` | Runs the esbuild watcher and both TypeScript project watchers in parallel |
| watch:esbuild | `bun run watch:esbuild` | Rebuilds the extension bundle and webview JS/CSS bundles on change |
| watch:tsc | `bun run watch:tsc` | Watches the extension TypeScript project with `--noEmit` |
| watch:webview:tsc | `bun run watch:webview:tsc` | Watches the webview TypeScript project with `--noEmit` |
| copy-wasm | `bun run copy-wasm` | Copies `sql-wasm.wasm` into `dist/` |
| package | `bun run package` | Creates the production extension/webview bundles used for packaging |
| vscode:prepublish | `bun run vscode:prepublish` | Runs the packaging build before publishing a VS Code extension |
| check-types | `bun run check-types` | Type-checks both the extension and webview projects |
| lint | `bun run lint` | Lints `src` and `webview-ui/src` |

### VS Code Debug Tasks

- `F5` uses the default `.vscode/tasks.json` `watch` task. That task first runs `bun esbuild.js` once so `dist/webview-client.css` exists before the extension host launches, then starts the extension TypeScript and esbuild watchers for subsequent debug edits.

### Environment Variables

- None. The extension does not read configuration from `process.env` or `Bun.env`; the z.ai API key is stored in VS Code `SecretStorage`.

### Validation

- `bun test` runs the regression check for local-time day bucketing in `src/db.ts`.

## Key Implementation Details

- **API Key Storage:** Uses VS Code's `SecretStorage` API (encrypted, OS-level keychain integration)
- **DB Queries:** Uses Drizzle ORM with the `sql.js` driver (pure WASM SQLite, no native modules) to query the local SQLite database. `src/db.ts` defines typed table metadata for the external Kilo tables it reads (`part`, `message`, `session`, `project`), loads the database into memory from disk, and executes the reporting queries synchronously against that in-memory copy. The six queries are still project totals, day totals, project-day totals, model costs (per project/provider/model), project models (step/token/cost breakdown), and day models. The project, project-day, and model cost queries additionally join the `project` table. Model cost/project-model/day-model queries still extract `providerID` and `modelID` from the `message.data` JSON field through SQLite `json_extract(...)` expressions. All queries filter on `step-finish` type entries. Day grouping applies the runtime local UTC offset directly from `dayjs().utcOffset()` rather than UTC, so daily totals align with the user's actual calendar day.
- **No External CLI Dependencies:** The extension does not require the `sqlite3` CLI or any other external command-line tool to be installed.
- **Webview:** The sidebar uses a webview with scripts enabled, `localResourceRoots` locked to `dist/`, a CSP meta tag, a nonce for the client bundle, and a flex-based layout so the active tab can fill the sidebar reliably. On first load the full HTML document is injected with all data; subsequent data updates are pushed via `postMessage` to avoid destroying Preact component state (scroll position, tab selection, expanded cards, filters).
- **Quota Recovery:** The extension stores the last successful quota snapshot in VS Code `globalState`, restores it for startup recovery when available, clears it on setup/auth errors, and uses timeout-based retry backoff for transient z.ai failures.
- **Daily Virtual List:** The daily tab, projects list, and model cost comparison lists use intersection observer-based lazy loading via a shared `useIntersectionLazyLoad` hook. Items are rendered in batches of 20 as the user scrolls — a sentinel element at the bottom of the visible items triggers the next batch via `IntersectionObserver`.
- **Runtime Dependencies:** `vscode` remains external to the bundle. `dayjs` is used at runtime for local-day grouping, model-data cache timing, and date-based summaries. `drizzle-orm` is bundled into `dist/extension.js` as the typed query layer. `sql.js` still provides the runtime SQLite engine, so the packaged extension must include `node_modules/sql.js`; its `sql-wasm.wasm` asset is also copied into `dist/` for `locateFile` to resolve. The webview loads `dist/webview-client.js` and inlines the esbuild-generated `dist/webview-client.css`, booting from a JSON payload script rather than `window.__TOKEN_LENS_DATA__`.
- **Model Cost Estimation:** `model-data.ts` fetches model pricing from the OpenRouter API (`/api/v1/models`) and caches it in memory for 1 hour. The serialized `WebviewData.pricingState` reports `loading`, `ready`, `cached`, or `unavailable` so the webview can keep token usage visible while showing inline pricing status, skeleton rows, cached-price notices, or unavailable messaging. Provider IDs from the local DB are mapped to OpenRouter format via `PROVIDER_ID_MAP`. Project-derived cost comparison model IDs in `src/webview/data.ts` apply the allowed-provider list (openai, deepseek, moonshotai, anthropic, z-ai, qwen, minimax) and a 90-day recency window before costs are computed from input, output, reasoning, and cache-read token totals. Models pinned from the global Cost tab are appended client-side to project and period comparisons without reapplying those provider/age filters. The global Cost tab starts from the fetched pricing list and applies provider/sort/age filters in the webview UI. Browser-side model-cost comparison rows expose a hover/focus popover that shows each token type's per-million-token price and the estimated-cost formula breakdown.
- **Settings Panel:** The extension exposes an in-webview settings panel (`webview-ui/src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx`) triggered by the `token-lens.openSettings` command when the sidebar webview already exists. The command asks the sidebar provider to send a `showSettings` inbound message to the webview, which requests current settings via `requestSettings`. The extension responds with `settingsData` containing `hasApiKey`, `refreshIntervalMinutes`, and `databasePath`. The webview can save a new API key (`saveApiKey`) or refresh interval (`saveRefreshInterval`) back to the extension, which persists them via SecretStorage and globalState respectively.
